VLevel 0.5 README

What is VLevel?

  VLevel is a tool to amplify the soft parts of music so you don't
  have to fiddle with the volume control.  It looks ahead a few
  seconds, so it can change the volume gradually without ever
  clipping.  Because the volume is changed gradually, "dynamic
  contrast" is preserved.

How do I install VLevel?
  
  See the file INSTALL.  For the impatient: "sudo make install".

How do I use VLevel?

  VLevel is a filter, meaning you pipe raw data to it, and it outputs
  the leveled data.  For example:

  vlevel-bin < in.cdda > out.cdda

  There are options to control the length of the look-ahead buffer,
  the strength of the effect, and the maximum amplification, as well
  as the format of the raw data.  Type "vlevel-bin --help" for
  details.

  VLevel also works as a LADSPA plugin.  See http://www.ladspa.org for
a lists of hosts that VLevel can plug into.

What other features are planed?

  A Ruby cross-platform GUI drag-n-drop converter that uses SOX.

Can I distribute VLevel?

  Please do.  VLevel is licenced under the LGPL, for more information,
  see the COPYING file.

Where can I get more info?

  There is documentation in the docs directory.  News, new versions,
  contact info, help, and more are available from the website:
